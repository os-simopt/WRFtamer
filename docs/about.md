<!--
- Should the EXP_NAME.yaml file be deleted once wt create has been executed? Afte all, the 
  configure.yaml file is here anyway, and I don't want to cause confusion. Furthermore, the .yaml files
  may pile up.
- remove link_grib from list of essential files? We have replaced the file with a python version, that is more dynamic. (works for GRIBFILE_XXXX.
