Guiding principles

- Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
- There should be an entry for every single version.
- The same types of changes should be grouped.
- Versions and sections should be linkable.
- The latest version comes first.
- The release date of each version is displayed.
- Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.

- Deprecated for soon-to-be removed features.

An unrelased section at the to keeps track of upcoming changes.
