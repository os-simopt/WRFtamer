## Issues

### Create a new Issue

If you spot a problem with WRFtamer, please first seach the issues on git if this problem has already marked.
If a related issue doesn't exist, you may open a new issue using the git issue form.

Please describe the issue in a way a developer can understand, so it can be solved. Most importantly state

- How you encountered the problem
- How to reproduce the problem

If you have suggestions on the solution, you may add these to the issue as well.

### Solve an Issue

If you want to solve an issue, you may scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. 
As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to developers outside the core developer group. If you find an issue
to work on, you are welcome to open a pull request with a fix.

### Pull request

When you are finished with the changes, create a pull request (PR). Do not forget to link your PR to an
issue if you are solving one.
