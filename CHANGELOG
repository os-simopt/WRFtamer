[V1.1.X] - 2022-05-10

New: pytests, code coverage and continous integration have been added to the Github repository.

Changed:
The package Cartopy is now and optional dependency of the repository and no longer a strict requirement. As a result,
map plotting tools will not work without cartopy.

This is due to the fact that the pip installation of cartopy fails due to dependency issues, which causes the continous
integration process

[V1.1] - 2022-02-21

Added
- New functionality: a "watchdog", i.e. an option to set a cronjob that checks if a run is complete and starts
 postprocessing if this is the case.
- A post processing protocol can now be set in the configure.yaml file (used by the watchdog)

Changed:
- In the xlsx files, the column "archived" is now called "status" and the entry is no longer a boolean, but
 a string describing the status. All places, where this column was used or set have been changed accordingly.
